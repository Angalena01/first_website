    <div class="col"><h2><p class="text-primary">"The Empire Strikes Back"</p></h2>
      <p>This Movie is arguably the best Star Wars movie made and i will not take no for an answer! It begins with the rebel alliance scattered throughout the galaxy being hunted by the imperial forces, leaving 
          princess Leia, Han Solo, and Chewbacca fighting the AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. Meanwhile Luke Skywalker is having a dandy old time learning to use the force by master Yoda to become a Jedi and eventually
          fight their biggest threat. While DarthVader is busy searching for his son, who he hasn't talked to in years. What GREAT parenting! Now it may seem like a mess (and it is) but I promise it's a really good movie.<p></p>

      <div class="col"><h2><p class="text-primary">"The Phantom Menace"</p></h2>
      <p> This movie is my absolute least favorite out of all the Star Wars movies, but some might disagree, and that's okay. (Not really but we'll say it is) Out of all nine movies, this was the only one i fell alseep during 
          and that's saying a lot. This movie introduces the audience to Anakin Skywalker when he was a little boy. The Phantom Menace is based around how Anakin became who we all know him as and basically how it all started. The plot
          of the movie is not bad at all, i just feel like the acting could have had more emotion to it and there could have been more action added to the story. The republic sent Obi- Wan and Qui-Gon to make trade negotiations
          with the leaders but the negotiations didn't go through. After escaping, they head to Naboo to warn the queen she's not safe. To protect her they then head to Tatooine where they meet the one and only young Anakin Skywalker.
          They see a great future of power within him and try to fix the trade negotiations and that's about it for that movie. Nothing really happened except for meeting Anakin that's why it was my least favorite. There was very 
          little intertaining parts.</p>

      <div class="col"><h2><p class="text-primary">"Revenge of the Sith"</p></h2>
      <p> This moive comes in second place on my list because of it's overall surprise factor. The turn of one of the characters from good to evil was so unexspected but good at the same time. Especially, for someone like me
          who has never seen a Star Wars movie before this. The fight scens were so good along with the actual plot of the movie. This movie takes place three years after the start of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker 
          tries to capture the chancellor because the council feels he is up to no good. When Anakin has visions of Padme in pain and wants to do anything to help her, even going as far as becoming the chancellor 
          (or also now as the sith lords) apprentice. While all this is going on Obi- Wan is doing his best to take down General Grevous and Darth Sidious from executing order 66, which could wipe out all the Republic.</p>
